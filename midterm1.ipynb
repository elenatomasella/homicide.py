    "CORRECTION OF THE PYTHON EXAM \n",
    "1) I have 3 variables. The first and the second one are floats, the third one is a a string. \n",
    "2) the code was an interation using two for loops. p ans s are numbers: they represents the indexes to iterate the strings with. We should be able to read the code and understand what it's doing. \n",
    "3) n is a number, a =0, b=1, c=0. then the code was using a while loop on n value. It was printing the Fibonacci sequence. \n",
    "4) it's a code with input function. in these cases it's not mandatory to read all the code to be able to answer the question. \n",
    "5) I have a while cycle and it was right to say that an infinite loop is not occuring once you enter a positive answer. \n",
    "6) definition of ifelse\n",
    "7) \n",
    "8) \n",
    "9) define halve_odd_numbers() returns a different list printing all the elements of the input lists but the odd ones are moddified as required. \n",
    "10) define substitude_vowel(s): it's simpler to use e string with all the vowels instead of a list. You can't change the char in a string, so you need to write a new one. it was so simple, don't know how I complicated my life :! However, it was also accepted to use the break. But it's preferable not to use it\n",
    "11) in the other exercise \n"
